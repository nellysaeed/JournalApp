Journal App This app is a simple Android application to manage task to-do with a title and a content.

The Main Activity Contains Sign in With Google and when you signed in it will redirect you to to-do task. You will add task and you can edit it or delete by long Click on the item.

I used SQLite database and I used firebase for Google sign in.
